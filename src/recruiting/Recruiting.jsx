        <p>We hope you will find this page full of helpful information about players, colleges, and recruiting. The Iowa Rockets mission includes helping girls reach their volleyball goal – during Club and into College. We have over <b>320 former Rockets</b> playing in college – from <b>New York to California, plus a few professional players</b> .</p>
        <p>We feel EVERY player has the ability to play at the collegiate level. It takes <b>hard work</b> both ON the court and OFF the court. As a Club, we also work hard to provide YOU with extensive <b>information and services to</b> help you find your college home:<br/>• Recruiting Seminar (in December)<br/>• Video recording session for Skills video<br/>• Specialized Recruiting Coordinator (see more info below)<br/>• Help with game highlight video<br/>• Help publishing your video for college coaches<br/>• How to reach college coaches<br/>• How to market yourself</p>
        <p>With 24 years and over 320 collegiate players, Iowa Rockets has <b>extensive connections</b> through the web of college coaches. Our <b>College Recruiting Coordinators (Rachel Berkland and Chin Nguyen)</b> , are the focal point for college coaches to contact Iowa Rockets. They work with YOU and your parents with:<br/>• Guidance on the recruiting process<br/>• Point of contact so college coaches can contact YOU (FYI – by NCAA regulations college coaches cannot directly contact a player before their Junior year in HS)<br/>• Working with your Club coach with college connections<br/>• Just to talk to!</p>
        <p>At Iowa Rockets we <b>care</b> about each player – both on and off the court. We are not a business; we are a group of coaches who love volleyball and enjoy helping players grow in their volleyball career.</p>
        <p> <b>What’s the cost</b> for the help Rockets provides with your recruiting process?  Zero!  It’s just part of being <b>in the Rockets family</b>.</p>
        <p> <b>To get started</b>, first contact David or Chin or Kyla.</p>
