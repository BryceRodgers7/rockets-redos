Courts 1 &amp; 2 at West Branch HS (sport court flooring in practice gym) are separated from courts 3 &amp; 4 (wood flooring in the Main gym).&nbsp; As mentioned before the school has air conditioning, but it might not keep up, so bring extra shirts.&nbsp; You can bring in all your own food (no plug in appliances) – but PLEASE clean up your camp area before you leave.&nbsp; No food or drink other than water allowed in either gym.&nbsp; Both gyms have bleacher seating; NO chairs are allowed in the main Gym (courts 3 &amp; 4).
